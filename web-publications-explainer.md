# Web Publications Explainer

This is a straw-man proposal to use the HTML ```nav``` element to bind together web resources into a publication. Think of this as commentary on the ongoing work of the W3C Publishing Working Group, as it happens in the [Web Publications Repo](https://www.github.com/w3c/wpub)

## Definition

A web publication is a collection of web resources, treated as a single work, which meets user expectations of personalization, simplicity, accessibility, ubiquity, and unity:

1. (controversial!) I can navigate through the publication without clicking a link
2. If I leave the publication and go back later, the browser remembers where I was
3. If I search on the page, the scope of the search is the entire web publication
4. I can always access the table of contents from the current page
5. The Web publication has a shareable URL
6. I can read the publication while offline
7. I can annotate the publication
8. I can easily change the font, font size, theme, etc.

## Mechanism


How do we bind this collection of resources together? We need a list of the primary resources, with a default order. That's an ordered list of URLs, which can be semantically represented by the HTML ```nav``` element.

Define the URL of a web publication to be the URL of this ‚Äúindex‚Äù document which contains the ```nav```. 


## Rules

1. A web publication must have an ‚Äúindex‚Äù resource containing a ```nav``` element.
2. The primary publication resources must be referenced in this ```nav``` element, in the default order.
3. The title of the index resource is the title of the web publication. If the title is absent, @dauwhe and @bigbluehat will come after you. 
4. The URL of the index resource is the URL of the web publication.
5. Constituent resources should have a ```rel=contents``` link to the index resource.
6. Constituent resources should have ```rel=prev``` and ```rel=next``` links as appropriate.
7. All HTML primary resources must have an üìñ attribute on the ```html``` element, to identify the resource as part of a web publication. The attribute may also be serialized as the text string ```book```. 

## Examples

See [Moby-Dick](https://dauwhe.github.io/zero-labs/MobyDickNav/MobyDickNav.html).

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html üìñ lang="en">
  <head>
    <title>Moby-Dick</title>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
  </head>
  <body>
    <main>
        <nav role="doc-toc">
          <ol>
            <li><a href="html/c001.html">Loomings</a></li>
            <li><a href="html/c002.html">The Carpet-Bag</a></li>
            <li><a href="html/c003.html">The Spouter-Inn</a></li>
            <li><a href="html/c004.html">The Counterpane</a></li>
          </ol>
        </nav>
     </main>
  </body>
</html>

```


## Offline

Service workers can allow offline reading of web resources. Script can easily create a list of primary resources to pass to a service worker, but obtaining a list of secondary resources is more problematic. This is where we hope for help from browsers, as authoring an exhaustive list of fonts, images, CSS files, etc. is no fun. 

## Experimentation

1. One way to create a single entity out of multiple HTML documents is to use the now-deprecated HTML Imports. We hope that some similar mechanism will come to the web platform soon, but there is still support (and a polyfill) for HTML imports. Ideally we'd place the imported content in shadow DOM to allow style encapsulation. 

## The State of the Art

We've drawn inspiration from Jeremy Keith's [Resilient Web Design](https://resilientwebdesign.com). This book is a beautiful example of a "bookish" experience on the web now, with good use of link relations, simple design, and beautifully clear, semantic HTML. The subject of the book is also on-topic.
